# Data Structures - Easy Guide

## 1. Arrays

An **array** is a way to store a list of things, all in a row, like numbers or words. Each item in an array is stored next to the other, and you can find it by its position (index).

- **Example**: A list of numbers `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.
- **Use Case**: When you want to store a list of things that you can access by their position, like a list of students' grades.

## 2. Linked Lists

A **linked list** is like a chain where each item (node) is linked to the next one. Each item contains data and a link to the next item in the chain.

- **Example**: `10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40` (Each number points to the next).
- **Use Case**: Useful when you need to add or remove items from anywhere in the list, like adding new tasks to a to-do list.

## 3. Stacks

A **stack** is a collection of things where you can only add or remove items from the top. It follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) rule—meaning the last item added is the first one to be removed.

- **Example**: A stack of plates. You take the top plate first.
- **Use Case**: Undo button in apps or web browsers.

## 4. Queues

A **queue** is a collection where the first item added is the first one to be removed. It follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) rule.

- **Example**: A line at a store. The person who gets in line first is served first.
- **Use Case**: Managing tasks, like printing documents or handling requests.

---

## 5. Hash Tables

A **hash table** is a way to store data with a unique identifier (key). The key is turned into a number by a special function, which tells where to store the data.

- **Example**: A dictionary where each word (key) has its definition (value).
- **Use Case**: Quickly looking up information, like finding a person’s contact details in a phone book.

---

## 6. Trees

A **tree** is a structure where each item (node) is connected in a way that forms a hierarchy. The top item is called the root, and it branches out to other nodes.

- **Example**: A family tree, where the oldest ancestor is at the top, and their children are below them.
- **Use Case**: Organizing things that have a parent-child relationship, like file systems on your computer.

---

## 7. Graphs

A **graph** is made up of nodes (dots) that are connected by lines (edges). A graph can show connections between different things, and the connections can go in one direction or both.

- **Example**: A social network where each person is a node, and a connection between two people is an edge.
- **Use Case**: Showing relationships between things, like finding the fastest route between two places on a map.

---

## 8. Heaps

A **heap** is a special tree where the parent node is always smaller (min heap) or larger (max heap) than the child nodes. It's good for managing data that needs to be accessed quickly.

- **Example**: A priority queue, where the most urgent tasks are handled first.
- **Use Case**: Quickly finding the highest or lowest value, like in a scheduling system.

---

## 9. Sets

A **set** is a collection of unique items. It doesn't allow duplicates and doesn't care about the order of the items.

- **Example**: `{1, 2, 3, 4}` (No repeated numbers).
- **Use Case**: Ensuring no duplicate items, like keeping track of unique users visiting a website.

---

## 10. Tries

A **trie** is a tree-like structure used to store words. Each node represents a letter, and you can follow the path of letters to find a word.

- **Example**: Storing words like "cat", "dog", "cow", and "bat".
- **Use Case**: Autocomplete search, where the system guesses the word you're typing based on the letters you've entered.
